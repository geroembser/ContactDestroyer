# ContactDestroyer ðŸ›³

Just a simple app that does nothing more than delete all contacts on your iOS device with one click â€“ so be careful! :warning:

## Getting Started

Surprisingly: Clone the project or download the zip file, open it in Xcode and RUN on your desired device or simulator! Very sophisticated...

## Intention

If you're building an app with access to the address book and it's all messed up :weary: or if you are just annoyed by John Appleseed and Co. as our favorite standard contacts in your iOS Simulator, use this ultra helpful but ultra extensive app with its gigantic code base...

## Contributing
Contributing is welcome at any time.
This app really needs a lot of good and committed contributors to fulfill its purpose.
